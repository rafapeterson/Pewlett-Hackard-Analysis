# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
For this analysis, employees who were born between 1952 & 1955 were counted, as they'd be retiring soon. To prevent a loss in knowledge, Pewlett-Hackard is considering implementing a mentorship program, for which all unique employees born in 1965 would be eligibile to participate.

## Results

 Based on a count of employees born between 1952 & 1955, an extremely large amount of **90,398** employees should be retiring within the next 10 years.*![Screen Shot 2021-10-27 at 8 23 22 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13009587/139099538-547dd3b4-ce28-4bbe-9ed6-36eceae04c81.png).  The "silver tsumani" as it has been called will cause a major disruption to the employee base of Pewlett-Hackard.
* The proposal of a formal mentorship program to mentor employees ~10 years younger than that of the retirement age were filtered out to create a list of potential mentees. The total count of those employees sits (currently) at **1940**, without considering possible future hires.
* Of those retiring, approximately 33% of the employees are currently senior egineers, with senior staff making up an additional ~31% of the retiring population.
* While the mentorship program could theoretically solve the potential major wave of loss of knowledge, consideration would need to be taken regarding the scalability & sustainability of the program. In order for the program to be most effective, the basic workflow through the program would need to be carefully conceived and executed. It would need to become a rolling program, where as employees get closer to their retirement age (length of tenure should be considered in this, as someone who has worked for the company longer will probably be able to retire younger than someone who has less tenure) they begin to transition from normal employee to mentee. Also, consideration for when mentoring employees assume their mentoring responsibilities should also be taken into consideration, as to not remove too much from production. The number of mentors should also proportionally represent the volume of retirement: i.e at present, emphasis on mentorship & atrition should be focused on senior engineers & staff.

## Summary
With the retirement of over 90,000 employees looming, special considerations need to be made surrounding hiring, promoting, and reorganization of employees. As of this analysis, there are 300,024 registered employees at Pewlett-Hackard, including those set to retire. Currently, the company would need to hire approximately 90,000 employees within the 3-5 years to experience no deficit in employees. However, with advancements in technology and automation, futher analysis should be performed to see if there is the option of reorganizing departments to help reduce the impact of the Silver Tsumani. </br> 
As for the number of potential mentors, if the previously proposed strategy of centralizing mentorship & prioritizing the program based on proportion of retiring employees, there should be no issue in the number of mentors needed.
